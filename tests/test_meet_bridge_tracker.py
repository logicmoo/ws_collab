"""Regression tests for ws_collab.meet_bridge.tracker.CaptionTracker.

Ported from the original design's test suite (once
``tests/test_meet_caption_bridge_tracker.py`` in the outer workbench
monorepo, testing ``scripts/meet_caption_bridge.py``'s tracker), unchanged in
behavior -- only the import path moved to the new native location. Covers
the "trap and relay raw changes" caption pipeline: cold-start baselining,
real-time growth relay under a single DOM row's key, and the
sentence-boundary "clone the line" split that gives the completed sentence
the OLD key and starts a brand-new key for whatever the row grows into
next -- verified live against a real Google Meet call growing exactly one
DOM row for an entire monologue.
